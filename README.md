# Route-Finder
 Route Finder â€“ Description
A Route Finder is an intelligent navigation tool designed to determine the most optimal path between two or more points on a map or within a defined environment. It leverages pathfinding algorithms and heuristics to identify routes that minimize distance, travel time, or other cost metrics like traffic congestion or fuel usage.

In the context of artificial intelligence, the Route Finder typically uses classical search algorithms such as:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Guarantees the shortest path in terms of number of steps, but not necessarily the fastest.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch, but may not find the optimal route.

A* (A-star): Combines actual distance traveled and an estimated distance to the goal (heuristic), making it both optimal and efficient.

These algorithms can be implemented on grid maps, road networks, or mazes, and are widely used in:

GPS and mapping applications (e.g., Google Maps)

Game development for AI movement

Robotics for real-time obstacle navigation

Emergency evacuation planning
